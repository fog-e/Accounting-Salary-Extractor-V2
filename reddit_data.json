Great for future accountants since low supply high demand is economics 101 for market opportunity. Glad it's not as competitive as engineering/finance since in any profession you have to go through bs at the beginning when you're first learning.\n\nHOWEVER, I would 100% say stay away from Big\n4 but often accountants tend to be risk adverse and seek stability in these firms. The WLB is non-existent and the money is terrible for the hours worked. In my opinion the best route is working for smaller PA firms  that have small business clients. Wide variety of work since you prepare the financial statements and tax return for each business and get to see what kind of sneaky companies make a killing which is very intellectually stimulating in my experience. Plus the work life balance is usually much better, I'm talking 45 hour busy season for two months in personal tax season with 37.5 hours the rest of the year focused on corporate work. Stay away from audit though, unless that is your passion. The work is mind numbing box ticking and you are often working on non for profit organizations, which personally is not my cup of tea. \n\nBut then again, no one tell you these things in school,  they don't prepare you for the real world at all.
