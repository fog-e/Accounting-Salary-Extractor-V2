This translates to a reduction in tax liability equal to the Deduction x your Marginal rate.

>I could also live very comfortably on $2,000 a month if I downsized my home and got rid of all but one of my cars.

There are a variety of ways in which retired people get by, including:

* Make and save a lot of money
* Own a modest home with moderate property taxes and affordable maintenance (and no mortgage)
* Live with family (or roommates)
* Find subsidized senior housing - where rent is like 30% of income 

And here in r/FinancialPlanning imo a good baseline is to own a modest home, with enough in savings to avoid auto loans and credit card balances.  Then an income of $2,000 a month can be enough.  (It's one way that people can live on social security.)

One difficult and frustrating problem is health care as Medicare generally only pays for care when doctors have a chance of fixing a specific medical problem.  And even then, payments for hospital and nursing home stays are limited.  So being able to deal with long term care requires either a lot of luck (and good timing with long term care insurance), or having a huge amount of money.  It's great if it's something you're able to address, but unfortunately for most of us the safety net is a combination of Medicaid and family.  And for many of us, the best we can do is to try to stay healthy, and there's a point where it's best not to stress too much about something that we can't control.",https://reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/1dtgj77/whats_the_minimum_salary_you_need_to_be_able_to/lbafcxm/

25k in savings is way above average for your age. It could be blown through easily if you don't manage it correctly. Consider keeping it in a HYSA if this is your emergency fund, you will get a lot of interest from it by doing so. I get like $20/month on only $5k. If you want to invest some of it, I'd suggest S&P 500 index funds. They're one of the safest investing option and will continue to grow over the years. 

What do you like about your job that you'd want to continue doing in your next role? What do you hate about it? How much does your life cost per year? You don't have to answer those here, but spend some time writing down what you do and do not want to do at work. Calculate how much your hobbies, housing, food, etc cost per year and include the things you want but don't have (like children, a house). Once you know how much your life will cost, you know what your salary needs to be for you to have those things and still put aside savings. If you're life is going to cost $70k per year, you'll likely need a job that pays $100k before taxes, for example. From there, look at jobs that pay that much and get more info on the ones that interest you the most. Taking the time to consider all of that was the only way I was able to decide what to do with my future.

In a regular savings account earning 0.01% interest, at the end of the year you'd have made maybe 50 cents in interest.

In a HYSA earning 4% (conservatively.  Most are offering between 4.25% and 5%) you'd make about $200 in interest.  The interest is taxed as income, so you'd pay somewhere around 12 to 22 percent to Uncle Sam (~20-40 dollars, leaving you with 160-180 dollars).  That's also assuming you don't immediately transfer your savings to a HYSA.  If you have $10,000 that you transfer to a HYSA, that would make you $400 in interest the first year.

The answer to that for me is simple after being the type that swore by renting. Especially when I lived in California, which is a very lopsided market that not many places in the US can compete with.

The conclusion?

I'm glad I bought, and locked in a low interest rate. Some of the costs has gone up, like property tax, but nowhere near what I'd have to pay today. The unit is worth around a million, and if I paid that today, my property tax would be more than double. Let alone the mortgage. 

You may say, well I could make that in the stock market as well. Sure you can, but I used leverage. I put down a lot less, was able to get tax benefits from it, and fixed a large portion of the living cost. 

That's why it always seems cheaper to rent, because there's built in inflation. I remember a decade ago or so, I rented a 2br/2ba condo in a nicer neighborhood, and was looking at $1500/month. Today, that's around $3k. If I bought the property back then, my expense might have been $2k, but it would be close to that today. You will benefit from that for life. 

What I would say though is, I personally by far prefer condo's over single family homes. People are concerned about HOA, and yes it is a concern, but nothing compared to the massive money sink a single family home is. Higher utility costs, you're responsible for every maintenaince instead of spreading it out, and  you're far more likely to own something way too big on top of it. Stick to manageable smaller frugal units. In high demand market, they will likely be better investment and lower maintenance and operating costs.",https://reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1du2g5e/renting_apartment_vs_owning_house_for_fire/lbef8j4/

I don't know if you consider Investopedia ""definitive"" enough, but a change in employment is absolutely a qualifying event which allows for changes to Dependent Care FSA: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/09/dependent-care-fsa.asp

>You can only change the amount of money that you choose to have withheld from your paycheck for the FSA within a 31-day window following a qualifying event, such as a marriage, the birth or adoption of a child, the death of a dependent, divorce, or a change in your (or your spouse’s) employment.

As far as the changes go:

>I handle all the finances so i've always done it through my job but now obviously it needs to change and I'd rather not lose the $208 pretax per month if possible

We're you and your husband each doing $208/month? That would be $5k annual which matches the limit, but I'm not sure if that's what you're doing.

To be clear, any dependent care expenses you incur after you quit are not eligible for imbursement. So you will need to run the numbers to see how what your actual expenses were prior to leaving your job and how much was reimbursed, and then adjust your husband's dependent care FSA amount to match, to cover that difference.",https://reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1dthail/daily_fi_discussion_thread_tuesday_july_02_2024/lbbn2kp/

I've invested $37,122.49 (including employer contributions) YTD, not including mortgage principal.  I've already maximized my IRA and I Bond contributions for the year.  I'm on course to do the same for my 401(k) and HSA by late December.  This will be my 11th consecutive year of maximizing all tax-advantaged accounts, and it's my 4th consecutive year of maximizing I Bond contributions.  I have targeted a 50% savings rate since 2021.  For reference, I'm 36, single with no children, work from home, and live in a HCOL region.  My net worth is around $1.25 million with $1.55 million in total assets, including $880,000 of investable assets.  I'm hoping to reach $1 million in investable assets by this day next year, but we'll see what happens.  What the market giveth the market can taketh away.

There have been a lot of small wins over the past few weeks and months and I thought I'd share some of them.

I recently transferred my ""play money"" brokerage account from SoFi to Robinhood to take advantage of their 1% brokerage transfer bonus as well as the benefits of Robinhood Gold.  They reimbursed me $75 of the $100 transfer fee that SoFi assessed.  I've already joined the waitlist for the Robinhood Gold Card, and I leveraged the $1,000 of free margin (no interest) to purchase $1,000 of SGOV (iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF).  The yield from SGOV on margin essentially pays for the Robinhood Gold membership, which is $5/month.

I just opened up some accounts with Laurel Road Bank (Loyalty Checking and High-Yield Savings) which is offering up to $640 in eligible bonuses and rewards over the first 12 months, plus 5.15% interest on my savings.  I also just discovered an in-state credit union offering 6% interest on the first $2,500 of deposits with no requirements, so I plan to open an account there.  Additionally, I've been taking some time to close old deposit accounts and credit cards that I no longer use and consolidating wherever possible.

One of my goals since May of last year (when my dishwasher died) was to replace and upgrade all of the large appliances in my home, which I've accomplished (with the exception of my kitchen range hood).  Unfortunately, I missed a sale on one of these appliances by a few weeks that would've saved me $300, but the price had remained steady for several months so I didn't anticipate a discount so soon.

My new auto insurance policy took effect today, but yesterday I added ""Zero Deductible Glass"" coverage onto my policy before renewing.  This added $118 to my 6-month premium, but it will save me almost $900 when I eventually replace my front windshield.  I was quoted around $1,000 for replacement earlier this year after it cracked from road debris that impacted my windshield on the highway.

I'm now exploring pet insurance options for my two cats.  I've looked at Progressive (where I have home and auto policies) and Lemonade so far.  Does anyone here have experience with either providers for pet insurance?  Any recommendations?

EDIT:  I ended up going with Lemonade for pet insurance.  They offered a competitive price, preventative care without a deductible, and seemed to be more transparent in their coverages.  Very easy process.",https://reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1dsoepn/daily_fi_discussion_thread_monday_july_01_2024/lb88crf/
